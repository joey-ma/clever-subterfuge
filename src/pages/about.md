<!-- ## Personal

### Background

I was born in Taiwan, migrated to Southern California ever since I was 14.

### Education

Having attended UC San Diego and studied **ICAM** (Interdisciplinary Computing & the Arts Major - with an emphasis in Music), I was introduced to programming as an artist, and have always enjoyed the artistic side of things.

<!-- ### Favorite Quotes

> There is, however, hope for any person who wants to remain an individual. He can assert himself and refuse to conform. He'll be on his own, that's true, but while he will not have the security enjoyed by those who do conform, there will be no limits to what he may achieve.

> The man who comes up with a means for doing or producing anything better, faster or more economically has his future and his fortune at his fingertips.

― _J. Paul Getty_

> No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.

― _Mary Shelley_   -->
